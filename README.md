Hi! ðŸ‘‹,

Welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ˜ƒ

I recently graduated with a B.Sc. in Information Systems and I'm excited to start my career in the field.

Check out my projects I've done so far using Python and SQL.

I'm constantly learning and growing, but these projects are a great starting point.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my page!
